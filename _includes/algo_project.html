      <p>The UChicago Algorithmic Trading Competition is a collegiate competition where students are given mock exchanges to trade against each other and the system<b>.</b> For the 2019 competition, there were three cases: Curve Trading, Options Market Making, and Dynamic Portfolio Allocation<b>.</b> We placed 1st overall for Options Market Making and high, but not top 3, for Dynamic Portfolio Allocation<b>.</b> For Options Market Making, we used a Delta/Vega hedging Black-Scholes Model strategy written entirely in C++<b>.</b> It was extremely fast and accurate, calculating and submitting several hundred orders a second, magnitudes faster than the competition<b>.</b> This allowed us to always be first on the book<b>.</b> To Delta hedge, we would market buy the equity when needed<b>.</b> To Vega hedge, we would calculate the most optimal options to buy to negate our Vega<b>.</b> This allowed us to take home first place in KU’s first competition appearance<b>.</b> The strategies for Curve Trading and Dynamic Portfolio Allocation were similar<b>.</b> For both we used <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis”>PCA</a> for dimensionality reduction and linear models for forecasting<b>.</b> For Curve Trading, we would also attempt to off-load dynamically, but it was difficult for us to get fills on the competition day<b>.</b> Overall, it was a great experience to work with a team and get experience in this field<b>.</b> If you are interested, here is the GitHub <a href = "https://github.com/AndreKurait/UChicagoMWTC2019">repo<b>.</b></a></p>

      <h2>Algorithmic Trading Experience - Blog Style Post</h2>
      <p>The UChicago Algorithmic Trading Competition was held in April of 2019 at the Polsky Exchange on UChicago's campus<b>.</b> There were around 30 teams that competed, most from Ivy League and other prestigious universities<b>.</b> There were three cases, one for curve trading futures, one for options market making, and one for dynamic portfolio allocation<b>.</b> I intend to make a paragraph describing our approach to each and one about how we prepared for the competition<b>.</b> For more information and our code can be found in our now public Github <a href = 'https://github.com/AndreKurait/UChicagoMWTC2019'>Repo</a><b>.</b></p>    
      <p>When I first invited the other three team members to his competition, I was met with skepticism<b>.</b> KU lacks both a statistics and mathematical finance department, so we doubted that we would even be accepted into the competition<b>.</b> After we submitted the application, we did not hear back for almost a month, during which we thought we had not been accepted<b>.</b> In late February, we were accepted into the competition set for mid-April and began our preparations<b>.</b> We met weekly in a local coffee shop and put together plans for our approaches<b>.</b> We read as many books as we could that would help like Hull's "Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives" and Natenberg's "Options Volatility and Pricing<b>.</b>"</p>
      <p><b>First Case - Curve Trading</b> was the most difficult case for us<b>.</b> None of us had previous experience with futures<b>.</b> After reading material online and discussing as a team, we settled on a strategy of buying and selling heavily correlated futures in different months in the attempt to self-hedge ourselves, like a calendar spread in options<b>.</b> Also, as with the other cases, the exchange was extremely barebones and required us to keep track of every aspect of data we submitted, causing issues of how to store data<b>.</b> While annoying at the time, it became a huge learning point for me<b>.</b> We had some success when trading in the practice simulator, but when we went live, we immediately got crowded out by the other participants<b>.</b> We did not lose money like some other teams, but we lacked the flashy high-valued profits like the winners of the case<b>.</b> After the competition, we learned that we were not purchasing large enough bundles and lacked a good strategy to sell purchased bundles effectively<b>.</b></p>
      <p><b>Second Case- Options Market Making</b> was the case that we looked forward to the most<b>.</b> Some of us had relevant experience, I have previously traded Options, and a team member and I worked at the Cboe together, which is an options exchange<b>.</b> KU's Computer Science Program is also extremely unique, as most classes are entirely in C++<b>.</b> True to this, we devised our plans in Python and converted them into C++<b>.</b> Our plan was a simple Delta/Vega hedging strategy using Black-Scholes, placing pegs around our calculated strike price as a function of Implied Volatility<b>.</b> Our code worked great and never SegFaulted in our practice sessions<b>.</b> The day of the competition, we had issues with other teams in our group, as they had buggy code that essentially was buying the entire order book of puts, causing the exchange to throw errors and incorrect prices<b>.</b> These errors would cause segmentation faults for us, as numbers simply did not make sense for our algorithm, as float-infinity price as a bid and ask is impossible<b>.</b> Our competition group of around seven teams had to be stopped multiple times to fix the crashed server, and we figured these errors would keep us from placing<b>.</b> While we did not know at the time, but we were the only team who had built everything in C++, a massive advantage for us<b>.</b> We ended up getting 1st, as our strategy followed with the spirit of the competition and was efficiently written in C++<b>.</b> We had also had ported the Python Black-Scholes calculators into C++, speeding our calculations up 5x<b>.</b></p>
      <p><b>Third Case - Dynamic Portfolio Allocation</b> was a case based on Fama-French ideas of portfolios and was graded on your yearly mean Sharpe Ratio<b>.</b> Our overall strategy was purely statistical using PCA for dimensionality reduction and linear models to forecast the price using the previous thirty days of information<b>.</b> We did not run into issues with overfitting as many other teams did, but we could have improved greatly with a few small changes<b>.</b> Ironically, I would start Financial Econometrics research the month after, in this exact topic, that would have helped us immensely<b>.</b> Using the forecasted prices, we used CVXPY, a convex optimization solver, to create optimal portfolios of several variances that we then would pick for the highest Sharpe Ratio<b>.</b> We ran into issues, as since our profit was so small, the forecasting error was more significant than if we had picked large variance, but higher profit portfolios<b>.</b> Overall, we were generally high in the rankings, but not enough to place in the top 3<b>.</b></p>
      <p> Overall, this competition was extremely interesting, as it is difficult to get actual experience in this domain<b>.</b> I learned a lot in a short amount of time and my applied programming skills greatly improved<b>.</b> From this, I brought back much of the knowledge to KU and am and have been giving tutorials to the students in the Finance Club in an attempt to bring Mathematical Finance to the university<b>.</b> One of my returning partners and I intend to create a team for next year for traders@MIT<b>.</b></p>
