        <p>Oaxaca-Blinder is a statistical method commonly used in labor and health economics. It is useful as it can help show what is explained and unexplained in differences between means for two groups, such as employment or wages. There are two different types of Oaxaca-Blinder, two-fold and three-fold. While similar, three-fold quantifies the interaction between the two effects in two-fold, which is left unshown in two-fold. However, two-fold is much easier to quantify than three-fold. In my GitHub repo, there is a good <a href = "https://github.com/AustinJAdams/Oaxaca.py/blob/master/Papers/Jann%2C%20Ben%20(2008).%20The%20Blinder-Oaxaca%20decomposition%20for%20linear%20regression%20models..pdf">paper</a> proposing the oaxaca command for STATA, which is where I got a lot of inspiration for design choices.</p> 
        <p>This package was started because, when studying this method for my Labor Economics class, I found there was no Python implementation. There was a group of students who said they had created one, but their GitHub repo has nothing in it. It also tested my ability to create a package that the entire world can see, like documenting your code and making it straightforward.</p>   
        <p>The code for this package is located <a href = "https://github.com/AustinJAdams/Oaxaca.py">here</a></p>
