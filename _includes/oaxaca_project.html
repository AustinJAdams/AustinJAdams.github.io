      <p>My Oaxaca-Blinder package is the first and only package that is able to do Oaxaca-Blinder Decompositions<b>.</b> I attempted to mimic the usage and style of the STATA and R commands, as they were extremely robust and well tested<b>.</b> A little bit about Oaxaca-Blinder is that it is a commonly used statistical method used in Labor and Health Economics, that helps explain the differences in two population means<b>.</b> By that I mean what is explained by the differences in the two group’s coefficients or data and what is left unexplained<b>.</b> An good usage for the method would be explaining the difference in mean wages of two different groups<b>.</b> There are two types of Oaxaca-Blinder, two-fold and three-fold<b>.</b> Two-fold’s coefficients are more interpretable but does not account for an interaction term<b>.</b> Three-fold has an interaction term that helps more robustly explain the difference, but generally that term is extremely small, leading it to be dropped<b>.</b> I also added some of the other commands that the other programming languages have in their implementation, but not all of them, as this is a working project<b>.</b> This project was inspired by an Economics professor of mine who is a big fan of Oaxaca-Blinder<b>.</b> I was also interested in doing this project because it helped me to better understand the statistical method and the life cycle of a package, as now I was the one creating the documentation and trying to write interpretable code<b>.</b>If you would like to take a look, here is the GitHub <a href = 'https://github.com/AustinJAdams/Oaxaca.py'>repo<b>.</b></a></p>

        <p>Oaxaca-Blinder is a statistical method commonly used in labor and health economics<b>.</b> It is useful as it can help show what is explained and unexplained in differences between means for two groups, such as employment or wages<b>.</b> There are two different types of Oaxaca-Blinder, two-fold and three-fold<b>.</b> While similar, three-fold quantifies the interaction between the two effects, which is left unshown in two-fold<b>.</b> This comes at the cost of ease of interpretability, going from “unexplained vs explained” to “coefficient vs characteristics vs interaction<b>.</b> In my GitHub repo, there is a good <a href = "https://github.com/AustinJAdams/Oaxaca.py/blob/master/Papers/Jann%2C%20Ben%20(2008).%20The%20Blinder-Oaxaca%20decomposition%20for%20linear%20regression%20models..pdf">paper</a> proposing the oaxaca command for STATA, which is where I got a lot of inspiration for design choices<b>.</b></p> 
        <p>This package was started because, when studying this method for my Labor Economics class, I found there was no Python implementation<b>.</b> There was a group of students who said they had created one, but their GitHub repo for it is empty<b>.</b> It also tested my ability to create a package that the entire world can see, like documenting your code, making it straightforward to use, and clean when examined<b>.</b></p>   
        <p>The code for this package is located <a href = "https://github.com/AustinJAdams/Oaxaca.py">here</a></p>
