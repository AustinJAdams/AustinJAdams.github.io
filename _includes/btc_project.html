        <p>Asset Pricing Theory has always been a subject that I have found interesting. I find it to be the perfect combination of style and math to be challenging and interesting. However, my ability to learn and trade algorithmically on my own is hindered by the extreme entry costs. Data feeds for traditional markets are sparse and extremely expensive, and the industry has progressed far beyond what one student can do in their free time. Cryptocurrency exchanges do not have these start-up costs that equity and options marketplaces have. Data is free and accessible, and the industry is not as systematic yet. I have had a three part journey with my ideas and ability to trade on the markets. </p> 
        <p><b>First,</b> I attempted to use triangular <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_arbitrage"> arbitrage</a> to trade, attempting to exploit price discrepancies due to imperfect markets. I also got my data using a REST API from <a href = "https://cryptowat.ch/">Cryptowat.ch</a>. Coding took an extremely long time, as I still was a novice in the Data Science Stack. By the time that I had finished my strategy to trade, most exchanges had adjusted their fees from near zero to enough to make my strategy unviable, as trading three times to exploit a small discrepancy became unviable. </p>
        <p><b>Second,</b> I used an LSTM Neural <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory">Network</a> to classify good and bad trades. I decided to do this right when I had started my Machine Learning class, as I thought Machine Learning was the end all strategy for everything. I upgraded to using a WebSocket at this point, cloning the top level bid/ask from Kraken. What I found out is that these models take a very long time to train, even with two powerful GPUs, so it was very hard to make any adjustments. This strategy attempted to do less price prediction and more classification of good trade vs bad trade using market factors. However, the long training time and long trade calculation time become problematic when attempting to make short-term predicitons, so I abandoned this idea. </p>
        <p><b>Lastly,</b> I am now attempting a new strategy that comes from my research. Because of success by academics using this idea for other markets, I am hesitantly optimistic to see if it works. I have also upgraded to cloaning the entire orderbook and all trades.</p>
        <p> Overall, I have learned a lot trying to trade on my own: the Data Science Stack, Neural Nets, WebSockets, Code Deployment, and SQL. This is still a huge benefit even if none is monetary. Much of this code is not public, except for the early API scrapper, so if you would like to see some of it, please contact me directly.</p>
