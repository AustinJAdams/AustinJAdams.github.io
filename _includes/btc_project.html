      <p>Cryptocurrencies have been an interest of mine since early high school<b>.</b> Before I began looking at their potential algorithmically, I traded them traditionally in a short-term buy and hold strategy<b>.</b> However, once I began coding, I started looking at them as a much cheaper and easy source for trading data<b>.</b> For a project in my data science class, I scrapped data from a REST API that I would then store in SQL, pull later, and attempt to back-test my triangle arbitrage algorithm<b>.</b> While basic, it would have made a profit at the time if the trades would go to plan, but because of an exchange fee hike, it became unviable<b>.</b> Next, I explored Markowitz Portfolio Optimization using mean-variance calculations to create portfolios<b>.</b> However, it quickly became apparent that liquidation of shorts was going to be a huge issue, as 10-20% jumps are not unheard of in the industry<b>.</b> Next, I attempted to use an LSTM Neural Network for trade classification, but long training, a few days, and calculation time, almost a minute, made it seem unviable<b>.</b> I also upgraded to using a WebSocket to clone orderbooks and trades for more factor isolation<b>.</b> Currently, I am using an idea generated from my research that has seen successes in traditional industries, which I am hesitantly optimistic<b>.</b> Overall, one of these ideas probably would have worked decently, but I have many fears about the efficiency of the markets and the morals of some of the larger players to continue with a decent idea<b>.</b> Most of the code is in a private GitHub repo, but I would share it if someone were to ask<b>.</b></p>

      <h2>Crypto Algorithmic Trading- Blog Style Post</h2>
      <p>Asset Pricing Theory has always been a subject that I have found interesting<b>.</b> I find it to be the perfect combination of style and math to be challenging and interesting<b>.</b> However, my ability to learn and trade algorithmically on my own is hindered by the extreme entry costs<b>.</b> Data feeds for traditional markets are sparse and extremely expensive, and the industry has progressed far beyond what one student can do in their free time<b>.</b> Cryptocurrency exchanges do not have these start-up costs that equity and options marketplaces have<b>.</b> Data is free and accessible, and the industry is not as systematic yet<b>.</b> I have had a three-part journey with my ideas and ability to trade on the markets<b>.</b> </p> 
      <p><b>First,</b> I attempted to use triangular <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_arbitrage"> arbitrage</a> to trade, attempting to exploit price discrepancies due to imperfect markets<b>.</b> I also got my data using a REST API from <a href = "https://cryptowat.ch/">Cryptowat<b>.</b>ch</a><b>.</b> Coding took an extremely long time, as I still was a novice in the Data Science Stack<b>.</b> By the time that I had finished my strategy to trade, most exchanges had adjusted their fees from near zero to enough to make my strategy unviable, as trading three times to exploit a small discrepancy became unviable<b>.</b> </p>
      <p><b>Second,</b> I explored using Markowitz style portfolios for dynamic allocation of portfolios, attempting to self-hedge by creating a long/short portfolio that negated variance<b>.</b> There were two main issues with this<b>.</b> One, it is difficult to short cryptocurrencies, as there are generally very high fees in most exchanges to do this<b>.</b> Using an only long portfolio was also impossible, because the currencies are extremely correlated to each other<b>.</b> Second, because the industry is ripe with pump and dump schemes, I could have a minor short position in one of these coins, which could cause a massive liquidation of my portfolio<b>.</b> The extreme movements make you susceptible to outliers, which would massively impact my portfolio<b>.</b></p>
      <p><b>Third,</b> I used an LSTM Neural <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory">Network</a> to classify good and bad trades<b>.</b> I decided to do this right when I had started my Machine Learning class, as I thought Machine Learning was the end all strategy for everything<b>.</b> I upgraded to using a WebSocket at this point, cloning the top level bid/ask from Kraken<b>.</b> What I found out is that these models take a very long time to train, even with two powerful GPUs, so it was very hard to make any adjustments<b>.</b> This strategy attempted to do less price prediction and more classification of good trade vs bad trade using market factors<b>.</b> However, the long training time and long trade calculation time become problematic when attempting to make short-term predictions, so I abandoned this idea<b>.</b> </p>
      <p><b>Lastly,</b> I am now attempting a new strategy that comes from my research<b>.</b> Because of success by academics using this idea for other markets, I am hesitantly optimistic to see if it works<b>.</b> I have also upgraded to cloning the entire orderbook and all trades so that I can create more factors that may be of statistical importance<b>.</b> I have also begun to explore a more extreme dimensionality reduction technique that allows me to take in more information and squeeze more factors out of the data<b>.</b></p>
      <p> Overall, I have learned a lot trying to trade on my own: the Data Science Stack, Neural Nets, WebSockets, Code Deployment, and SQL<b>.</b> This is still a huge benefit even if none is monetary<b>.</b> Much of this code is not public, except for the early API scrapper, so if you would like to see some of it, please contact me directly<b>.</b></p>
